# Allison-Project3-Oreophryne

This is my repo for project 3.
The dataset I have chosen to analyze is the ImageJ measurements of photos I took of Oreophryne and Auparoparo to determine if the taxonomic traits I suspected are truly informative.

Raw data includes: .csv of measurements taken before processing
